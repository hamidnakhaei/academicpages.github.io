I recently graduated from Sharif University of Technology with a master's degree in Industrial Engineering. My master's thesis employs a reinforcement learning approach for dynamic pricing in the electricity retail market, with Iran’s power grid as a case study. My research interest is at the interface of statistical analysis and optimization under uncertainty in the areas of pricing and revenue management.

  _Description_: <br />
    - Commission Simulation: Led the simulation of a new commission structure governing all sales personnel compensation within the Solico Group. The objective was to evaluate and provide managerial insights on the new commission structure's impact on sales force compensation and sales growth before implementation. During this phase, top-level managers were advised on the new structure using a well-developed simulation, enabling them to decide the optimal structure to enact. This work was carried out in collaboration with the SAP, sales planning, strategic planning, financial planning, and human resources teams.
    - Commission Calculation: After the commission structure was enacted, I undertook the process of implementing and calculating the new structure for the first month. Following the identification and resolution of some bugs, the project was handed over to the commission team.
    - Data Visualization: Collaborated with regional sales planners on data visualization and provided insights derived from the visualized data. <br />
