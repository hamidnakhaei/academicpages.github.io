I recently graduated from Sharif University of Technology with a master's degree in Industrial Engineering. My master's thesis employs a reinforcement learning approach for dynamic pricing in the electricity retail market, with Iran’s power grid as a case study. My research interest is at the interface of statistical analysis and optimization under uncertainty in the areas of pricing and revenue management.
